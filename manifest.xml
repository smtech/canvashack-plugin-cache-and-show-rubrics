	<description><![CDATA[
<p>It appears that, when an assignment uses an LTI as an external tool for assignment submissions, it is no longer possible to work adequately with rubrics. <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/thread/1345">It <em>is</em> possible to create a workflow to create the rubrics</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the assignment in Canvas, set submission type to anything <em>except</em> "External Tool"</li>
<li>Add/create the rubric, as usual</li>
<li><strong>Cache the rubric using this CanvasHack</strong></li>
<li>Change the Canvas assignment submission type to "External Tool" and configure as usual. (There may be a glitch here -- you might need to return to the general assignment list after changing the submission type and then re-open the assignment)</li>
<p>This CanvasHack provides a bookmarklet for the teacher to cache the rubric so that it can then be displayed in the assignment view later for the students.</p>
